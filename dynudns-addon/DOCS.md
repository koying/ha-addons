# Home Assistant Add-on: DynuDNS

## Installation

Follow these steps to get the add-on installed on your system:

1. Navigate in your Home Assistant frontend to **Supervisor** -> **Add-on Store**.
2. Find the "DynuDNS" add-on and click it.
3. Click on the "INSTALL" button.

## How to use

1. Visit [dynu.com](https://www.dynu.com) and create an account by logging in through any of the available account services (Google, Github, Twitter, Persona, Reddit).
2. In the `Control Panel` area, click on the `DDNS services` section, click `Add`. Choose amongst the available domains, and type the name of the subdomain .
3. If registration was a success, the subdomain is listed in the `DDNS services` section along with `current ip` being the public IP address of the device you are currently using to access `dynu.com`. The IP address will be updated by the DynuDNS add-on.
4. In the DynuDNS add-on configuration, perform the following:
    - Copy the DynuDNS API key (in the control panel, go to `API credentials`, reveal and copy) from `dynu.com` and paste into the `token` option.
    - Update the `domains` option with the full domain name you registered. E.g., `my-domain.ddnsfree.com`.

## Configuration

Add-on configuration:

```yaml
lets_encrypt:
  accept_terms: true
  certfile: fullchain.pem
  keyfile: privkey.pem
token: sdfj-2131023-dslfjsd-12321
domains:
  - my-domain.ddnsfree.com
aliases: []
seconds: 300
```

Additionally, you'll need to configure the Home Assistant Core to pick up the SSL certificates. This is done by setting the following configuration for the [HTTP][HTTP] integration configuration in your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
http:
  ssl_certificate: /ssl/fullchain.pem
  ssl_key: /ssl/privkey.pem
```

### Option group `lets_encrypt`

The following options are for the option group: `lets_encrypt`. These settings
only apply to Let's Encrypt SSL certificates.

#### Option `lets_encrypt.accept_terms`

Once you have read and accepted the Let's Encrypt[Subscriber Agreement](https://letsencrypt.org/repository/), change value to `true` in order to use Let's Encrypt services.

#### Option `lets_encrypt.certfile`

The name of the certificate file generated by Let's Encrypt. The file is used for SSL by Home Assistant add-ons and is recommended to keep the filename as-is (`fullchain.pem`) for compatibility.

**Note**: _The file is stored in `/ssl/`, which is the default for Home Assistant_

#### Option `lets_encrypt.keyfile`

The name of the private key file generated by Let's Encrypt. The private key file is used for SSL by Home Assistant add-ons and is recommended to keep the filename as-is (`privkey.pem`) for compatibility.

**Note**: _The file is stored in `/ssl/`, which is the default for Home Assistant_

### Option: `ipv4` (optional)

This option allows you to override the auto-detection and specify an
IPv4 address manually.

If you specify a URL here, contents of the resource it points to will be
fetched and used as the address. This enables getting the address using
a service like https://api.ipify.org/ or https://ipv4.text.wtfismyip.com

### Option: `ipv6` (optional)

This option allows you to override the auto-detection and specify an
IPv6 address manually.

If you specify a URL here, contents of the resource it points to will be
fetched and used as the address. This enables getting the address using
a service like https://api6.ipify.org/ or https://ipv6.text.wtfismyip.com

### Option: `token`

The DynuDNS API key found inside the Dynu control panel. The token is required to make any changes to the subdomains registered to your account.

### Option: `domains`

A list of DynuDNS subdomains registered under your account.

### Option: `aliases` (optional)

A list aliases of domains configured on the `domains` option.
This is useful in cases where you would like to use your own domain.
Create a CNAME record to point at the DynuDNS subdomain and set this value accordingly.

For example:

```yaml
domains:
  - my-domain.dynudns.org
aliases:
  - domain: ha.my-domain.com
    alias: my-domain.dynudns.org
```

Don't add your custom domain name to the `domains` array. For certificate creation, all unique domains and aliases are used.

Also, don't forget to make sure the dns-01 challenge can reach Duckdns. It might be required to add a specific CNAME for that:

```
CNAME _acme-challenge.<own-domain>    _acme-challenge.<domain>.dynudns.org
CNAME                 <own-domain>                    <domain>.dynudns.org
```

### Option: `seconds`

The number of seconds to wait before updating DynuDNS subdomains and renewing Let's Encrypt certificates.

## Known issues and limitations

- A free DynuDNS account is limited to four subdomains.
